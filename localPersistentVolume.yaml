#
#  A local volume represents a mounted local storage device such as a disk, partition or directory.
#
#  Local volumes can only be used as a statically created PersistentVolume. Dynamic provisioning is not supported yet.
#
#  Compared to hostPath volumes, local volumes can be used in a durable and portable manner without manually scheduling Pods to nodes, as the system is aware of the volume’s node constraints by looking at the node affinity on the PersistentVolume.
#
#  However, local volumes are still subject to the availability of the underlying node and are not suitable for all applications. If a node becomes unhealthy, then the local volume will also become inaccessible, and a Pod using it will not be able to run. Applications using local volumes must be able to tolerate this reduced availability, as well as potential data loss, depending on the durability characteristics of the underlying disk.
#  PersistentVolume nodeAffinity is required when using local volumes. It enables the Kubernetes scheduler to correctly schedule Pods using local volumes to the correct node.
#
#  PersistentVolume volumeMode can now be set to “Block” (instead of the default value “Filesystem”) to expose the local volume as a raw block device. The volumeMode field requires BlockVolume Alpha feature gate to be enabled.
#
#  When using local volumes, it is recommended to create a StorageClass with volumeBindingMode set to WaitForFirstConsumer. See the example. Delaying volume binding ensures that the PersistentVolumeClaim binding decision will also be evaluated with any other node constraints the Pod may have, such as node resource requirements, node selectors, Pod affinity, and Pod anti-affinity.
